      p Dear Art Lovers: <br/> <br/> 
      
      p We are saddened to inform you that after 25 years in business, Global Contemporary Art Tours Group, LTD will shut down its operations in 2019. We deeply appreciate our loyal customers and are proud to have taken you to many wonderful and ground-breaking art exhibitions all around the globe, no matter how remote the event: from traveling to the <i> Yokohama Triennale </i> to the <i> Skulptur Projekte Münster</i>; taking our customers to the last 12 editions of the Venice Biennale; visiting Dakar, Sao Paulo, Dhaka, together; and so on…

      p Unfortunately, all international exhibitions – following the dissolution of the European Union; the unilateral suspension of visa and banking agreements by the United States; the institution of military dictatorships throughout Latin America; the defunding of the United Nations; the withdrawal from the Internet by the Russian Federation; the absorption of the South into the North Korea; and the deployment of total surveillance systems by the People’s Republic of China – have now been cancelled. Any travel reservations you may have made with us after our closing date is now effectively void.

      p Due to the nature of this closure, we will be in limited operations in the coming months. We will not be able to help you make alternative arrangements for travel to your final destination after the cancellation of our last flight.
            
      p Sincerely,
      
      p Kevin O. Dalton
