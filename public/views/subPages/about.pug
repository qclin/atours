    p.main-text Your Flight Is Cancelled is a new e-flux project conceived by Julieta Aranda and Anton Vidokle. Part a bankrupt travel agency, part literally fiction, this itinerant installation and website speculate about a near future in which international movement of people, art and ideas grind to a halt. Beginning with a window display at NICC Brussels this fall, Your Flight Is Cancelled will appear in installments of short prose, images and video by a group of contributors including Brian Kuan Wood, Kaye Cain-Nielsen, Benjamin Bratton, Bruna Mori, Jörg Heiser, Chus Martínez, Ingo Niermann,  and others.
